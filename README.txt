Use of AI:
- For this delivery I really tried to use as much of my own abilities as posible since I know i abused a
bit too much on the 2D game.
- I used AI to help me get rid of my weird Wall collisions with the ball.
- I used it to help me fix some glitches I had with my audio not working properly.
- Lastly, I used it for a something that I didnt even manage to make work which was the coyote timer for the jump.
- The rest of the Project is done almost entirely by me and the code snippets provided by our teacher in class.
